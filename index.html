        <time>1995</time> Baden-Württemberg Prime Minister Erwin Teufel and Edzard Reuter,
Chairman of the Board at Daimler-Benz AG, establish Höchstleistungsrechner
für Wissenschaft und Wirtschaft GmbH (HWW). HWW for the first
time ever brings industry and science together in one company for the use
of supercomputers, establishes a sustainable business model, and gives
Daimler and Porsche direct access to the fastest computers in the world.

        <time>1996</time> Prime Minister Teufel founds the High-Performance Computing
Center Stuttgart (HLRS) as Germany‘s first national high-performance
computing center. HLRS is a division within the computing
center of the University of Stuttgart, and Prof. Rühle is
named director. At the founding ceremony, HLRS also announces
the beginning of production of a new Cray supercomputer, the
7th fastest system in the world.

    <li>
      <div>
        <time>1998</time> HLRS initiates the first European project
for metacomputing (METODIS). Its success
convinces the EU to create its own funding
stream for metacomputing and grid computing,
and establishes HLRS as a leading HPC
research center at a Europe-wide level.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>1999</time> In partnership with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center (USA), HLRS for the first time connects two
supercomputers to solve a simulation problem.
In recognition of the achievement, HLRS receives
an award from the US National Science Foundation
(NSF) for Real Distributed Supercomputing.

Oettinger welcomes a new HLRS supercomputer,
a NEC SX-8, and opens the center‘s
new building on Nobelstraße. For the first
time, an HLRS computing system achieves
performance at the teraflop scale.

        <time>2008</time> With the creation of the Automotive Solution
Center for Simulation (ASCS), HLRS founds its
first Solution Center. This is followed in 2018
with the establishment of the Media Solution
Center, and a Medical Solution Center is planned
to start operation in 2022.
